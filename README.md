# machine-learning

The goal of machine learning is to enable machines to identify patterns from data, extract the patterns, and based on them, make a prediction automatically. These capabilities are the core of artificial intelligence (namely, to make machines learn without being explicitly programmed using fixed predetermined rules). The applications of machine learning are immense, since nowadays we are bombarded with a huge number of various data from various sources. I hope machine learning can make sense of this huge seemingly incomprehensible data.
